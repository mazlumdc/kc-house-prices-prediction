We will adopt a data science workflow that includes:

Acquisition (importing data)
Explore (Explarotary Data Analysis & Feature Engineering)
Scrub (clean data, deal with missing values and data types)
Model (create our predictive model)
Interpret (comment on our model and findings)


In this study, house prices were tried to be estimated with various models. The coding and logical absorptions used in the study can be adapted to different studies.
